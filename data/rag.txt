Artificial intelligence is a broad field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence.
These tasks include reasoning, learning, perception, and decision-making.
AI systems are widely used in modern applications such as search engines, virtual assistants, and fraud detection systems.
The goal of artificial intelligence is to build machines that can adapt and improve over time.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows systems to learn patterns from data.
Instead of being explicitly programmed, machine learning models are trained using examples.
As more data becomes available, these models can improve their accuracy.
Common machine learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.

Deep learning is a specialized area of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers.
These neural networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain.
Deep learning models perform exceptionally well in tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing.
However, they often require large datasets and significant computational resources.

Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes called neurons.
Each neuron processes input data and passes the result to the next layer.
Training a neural network involves adjusting weights to minimize prediction error.
Backpropagation is a commonly used algorithm for training neural networks.

Cloud computing enables on-demand access to computing resources over the internet.
It allows organizations to scale their infrastructure without owning physical hardware.
Popular cloud service providers include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
Cloud computing supports services such as data storage, application hosting, and machine learning deployment.

Distributed systems consist of multiple computers working together to achieve a common goal.
These systems improve reliability and scalability by distributing workloads.
Failures in one node do not necessarily cause the entire system to fail.
Examples of distributed systems include microservices architectures and peer-to-peer networks.

Databases are used to store and manage structured information.
Relational databases organize data into tables with rows and columns.
SQL is commonly used to query relational databases.
Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.

NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data.
They provide flexible schemas and horizontal scalability.
Common types of NoSQL databases include document stores, key-value stores, and graph databases.
MongoDB and Cassandra are popular NoSQL database systems.

FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python.
It is known for its high performance and automatic API documentation.
FastAPI uses Python type hints to validate request and response data.
It is commonly used to build machine learning and AI-powered services.

REST APIs follow a stateless client-server architecture.
They use HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
RESTful services exchange data using formats like JSON.
These APIs are widely used for communication between frontend and backend systems.

Vector embeddings are numerical representations of text.
They capture semantic meaning rather than exact word matches.
Embeddings allow similarity comparisons between pieces of text.
They are essential for search engines and recommendation systems.

Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors.
It is commonly used to compare embedding similarity.
A higher cosine similarity indicates closer semantic meaning.
This metric is widely used in natural language processing tasks.

The capital of Japan is Tokyo.
Tokyo is one of the most populous cities in the world.
It is known for its advanced public transportation system.
Tokyo combines modern technology with traditional culture.

The solar system consists of the Sun and the objects that orbit it.
Planets, moons, asteroids, and comets are part of the solar system.
Earth is the third planet from the Sun.
The study of space is known as astronomy.

Photosynthesis is a biological process used by plants to produce energy.
It converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen.
This process is essential for life on Earth.
Photosynthesis forms the base of the food chain.

Cybersecurity focuses on protecting systems and networks from attacks.
Common threats include malware, phishing, and ransomware.
Strong authentication and encryption help improve security.
Cybersecurity is critical for protecting sensitive data.

Software engineering involves designing, building, and maintaining software systems.
It emphasizes code quality, testing, and maintainability.
Version control systems like Git are essential tools for software engineers.
Good engineering practices improve long-term system reliability.
